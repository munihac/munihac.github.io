            MuniHac is a Haskell hackathon in the tradition of other Haskell Hackathons such as the ZuriHac, HacBerlin,
            UHac and many others. MuniHac is hosted and sponsored by TNG Technology Consulting GmbH and co-organized by
            Well-Typed LLP, and usually takes place in the beautiful city of Munich.

            This year due to the ongoing Corona situation, MuniHac will take place as a two-day online event filled with
            Haskell talks and workshops that will be streamed via the internet, as well as the opportunity for hacking
            sessions. MuniHac is free to attend.
