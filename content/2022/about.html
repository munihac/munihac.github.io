    <h1>About MuniHac</h1>
    <p>We're glad to announce that MuniHac will be back this year, as an on-site event in Munich.</p>
    <p>MuniHac is a three-day Haskell hackathon and conference hosted in the beautiful city of Munich. It's aimed at
        both Haskell beginners and experts, featuring both a beginners track and talks from Haskell experts from all
        over the world. And it's free (as in beer)! MuniHac 2022 will be primarily on-site, but like in the previous
        years, some of the talks will be available via streaming, too.</p>
