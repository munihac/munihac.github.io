            <h1>About MuniHac</h1>
            <p>We're glad to announce that MuniHac will be back this year, as an on-site event in Munich.</p>
            <p>MuniHac is a three-day Haskell hackathon and conference hosted in the beautiful city of Munich. It's
                aimed at both Haskell beginners and experts, featuring both a beginners track and talks from Haskell
                experts from all over the world. And it's free (as in beer)! MuniHac 2022 will be primarily on-site, but
                like in the previous years, some of the talks will be available via streaming, too.</p>
            <p><b>MuniHac 2022 will be take place at a new location</b>, the TNG office at Arabellapark, Munich. This
                new location provides space for more people, and is a lot closer to the city center! <b>Please take the
                    new location into account when booking your accomodation!</b></p>
