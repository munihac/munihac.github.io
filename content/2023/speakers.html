        <h5>Haskell at the Heart of Terabit Laser Communication</h5>
        <p>
          In this talk, we'll explore how Haskell addresses challenges in high-speed laser data transmission between
          ground stations and satellites. We'll discuss atmospheric-induced signal deformations and the use of adaptive
          optics with segmented mirrors to counteract them. The crucial role of wavefront sensors operating at 5
          kilohertz for managing terabit-level throughput will be highlighted.
        </p>
        <p>
          We'll focus on mirror segment calibration, including computing 256 two-dimensional gravity points in a
          3-microsecond timeframe. To overcome limitations of standard processors, we'll describe our use of the Clash
          compiler to transform Haskell to low-level VHDL in order to create a suitable FPGA configuration. Join us to
          gain insights into Haskell's efficient application and its combination with the Clash compiler in
          high-performance computing scenarios. A key section of the talk will be dedicated to our methodical approach
          in Haskell, starting from a high-level specification and refining it to a detailed specification that meets
          the performance requirements of 3 microseconds. Our goal is to provide a deep understanding of how Haskell, in
          combination with the Clash compiler, can be efficiently applied in high-performance computing scenarios.

        <h5>React + Reflex: Harmonizing TypeScript and Haskell with Functional Reactive Programming</h5>
        <p>(Slides available on <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1xz36u2462BDeq9gxTMze17JrIkVXK6nZO_8BWgnBc4E/edit?usp=sharing" target="_tab">Google Slides</a>)</p>
        <p>
          Learn how to combine the best of both TypeScript and Haskell for frontend development. For TypeScript
          developers, you will learn how to take the reactive principles that made React successful to the next level
          with pure Functional Reactive Programming (FRP). For Haskell developers, you will learn how to easily
          integrate with the broader JavaScript ecosystem.

        <h5>Glean: query your code</h5>
        <p>
          Code indexing is the technology underlying many of the essential tools in the developer's workflow, from IDEs
          to code search to analysis tools. But code indexing is fragmented: it's usually done differently for each
          language and even each tool. Technologies like LSIF aim to unify across languages, but are aimed at specific
          tools or use cases. Glean is an open-source code indexing system we're building at Meta that fills the gaps:
          scaling to multiple languages, to very large codebases, and crucially including a flexible and powerful query
          language ("Angle") designed specifically for querying data about code. In this talk I'm going to cover the
          design of Glean and in particular its interesting query language, and also cover some of the ways that
          functional programming was useful in building Glean.

        <h5>Workshop: Parser Combinators</h5>
        <p>
          In this introductory workshop on parser combinators we will: 
          <ul>
            <li>Sketch how parser combinators work</li>
            <li>Contrast simple hand-written parser combinators with a production-ready library such as megaparsec</li>
            <li>Show how to use parser combinators to parse some simple languages</li>
            <li>Discuss some of the pitfalls one can run into when using parser combinators</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          This workshop should mostly be understandable for Haskell beginners. Parsers are a compelling non-trivial
          application of typical abstraction patterns such as applicative functors and monads and can therefore be
          helpful in order to build more intuition with these concepts
