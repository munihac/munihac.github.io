        In this talk, we'll explore how Haskell addresses challenges in high-speed laser data transmission between
        ground stations and satellites. We'll discuss atmospheric-induced signal deformations and the use of adaptive
        optics with segmented mirrors to counteract them. The crucial role of wavefront sensors operating at 5 kilohertz
        for managing terabit-level throughput will be highlighted.

        We'll focus on mirror segment calibration, including computing 256 two-dimensional gravity points in a
        3-microsecond timeframe. To overcome limitations of standard processors, we'll describe our use of the Clash
        compiler to transform Haskell to low-level VHDL in order to create a suitable FPGA configuration. Join us to
        gain insights into Haskell's efficient application and its combination with the Clash compiler in
        high-performance computing scenarios. A key section of the talk will be dedicated to our methodical approach in
        Haskell, starting from a high-level specification and refining it to a detailed specification that meets the
        performance requirements of 3 microseconds. Our goal is to provide a deep understanding of how Haskell, in
        combination with the Clash compiler, can be efficiently applied in high-performance computing scenarios.
