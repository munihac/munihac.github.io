        <h1>Call for Contributions</h1>
        <h3>We're looking for talks, workshops and projects!</h3>
        <p>You have a Haskell project you want to present? You're working on a library or framework? You have insights
            you want to share?</p>
        <p>
            We're looking for different types of contributions:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Talks:</b> We will have several slots of 45 minutes for talks about Haskell concepts or projects.
            </li>
            <li><b>Workshops:</b> 1.5-2 hours for groups of 10-20 people. In particular, we're also looking for
                workshops aimed at Haskell beginners.</li>
            <li><b>Projects:</b> What's a hackathon without hacking? If you want to host a project, let us know, and
                we'll announce it early on. Why don't you consider offering a talk for getting people started with your
                project? If you don't want to commit just yet, we'll also offer the opportunity to spontaneously pitch
                projects at the beginning of MuniHac.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <p>If you have an idea that you would like to present or host, please send us some information, either via
            <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf-nfNtrq3EBAI2744z434oYvwG-F2GrMNnWZWjSIoYu9kScw/viewform">this Google Form</a>, or via email
