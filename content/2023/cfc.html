        <h2>We're looking for projects!</h2>
        <p>What's a hackathon without hacking? If you want to host a project, let us know under <a
                href="mailto:munihac@tngtech.com">munihac@tngtech.com</a>, and
            we'll announce it early on.</p>
        <p> Why don't you consider offering a talk for getting people started with your
            project? If you don't want to commit just yet, we'll also offer the opportunity to spontaneously pitch
            projects on Saturday, July 8th.</p>
