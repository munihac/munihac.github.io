            <p>MuniHac is an annual hackathon and conference in Munich that brings together Haskell developers and
                enthusiasts from all over the world. It will take place from Friday, July 7th till Sunday, July 9th as
                an on-site event at the headquarters of <a href="https://www.tngtech.com/en/index.html">TNG</a> at
                Beta-Straße 13, 85774 (Unterföhring).</p>
            <p>There will be a diverse range of workshops, talks, and coding challenges for both beginners and
                experienced developers! This year's edition is even more special because all participants are also
                invited to attend Big Techday 23 – TNG’s conference on science and IT! This combination makes MuniHac a
                unique chance to improve Haskell skills, listen to talks by world-class speakers and network with other
                experts in the IT community.</p>
            <p>Join us for free for an unforgettable hackathon and conference filled with learning, networking, and fun!
                If you are unable to attend in person, you can re-watch most talks on YouTube after the event.</p>
