          Refinement types decorate the types of a programming language with logical predicates to allow more expressive
          type specifications. Originally, refinement type based specifications were restricted to SMT decidable
          theories and allowed automatic “light” verification, for example properties like non-division by zero or
          in-bound indexing. Verification of such light properties though requires “deeper” specifications, for example
          “is append associative?” In this talk, we will interactively see how to use the refinement type checker of
          Liquid Haskell to verify Haskell programs.

          The <code>.cabal</code> file defines what encompasses a package in the Haskell ecosystem. It is strictly
          required if you want to upload your package to Hackage. As such, almost anyone has to write or modify
          <code>.cabal</code>
          files at some point in their Haskell career, but due to its unique syntax, this often proves harder than
          necessary. Recently, Haskell Language Server started to close the gap between support for Haskell and cabal
          source files, by introducing the cabal-plugin.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this talk, we are going to take a closer look at the integration of the cabal-plugin into the architecture
          of the Haskell Language Server and explore its key concepts for providing a snappy, interactive developer
          experience. We are going to discuss the Language Server Protocol, and the plugin architecture, which allows us
          to extend HLS with a minimal amount of effort. These features will be explained by doing a deep-dive into the
          "cabal-plugin", which allows HLS to check <code>.cabal</code> files for syntax errors, provide completions,
          and even more features that help to read, write and modify <code>.cabal</code> files

          With Hécate, we will approach the topic of Effect Systems to write Haskell applications, understand why it is
          important do have semantic effect tracking in your software, and see how it all fits into the design and
          maintenance of software systems. We will use Effectful, developed for industrial needs of performance and
          ease-of-use.

          In December I'll be wrapping up my 3-year tenure of the CLC chair and I'd like to present a CLC activities
          report for this period. Brief introduction to CLC structure, roles and responsibilities; case studies for past
          CLC proposals; crash course "how to get your proposal approved"; preparations for PVP 1.1; review of core
          libraries. I hope to demistify the work of the committee and inspire people to apply for vacant positions
          early next year.

        <p>Have you ever wondered how synthesizers work? How about building your own, using Haskell?</p>
        <p>
          In this workshop we'll introduce some basic notions of sound synthesis, and will take a look at how to apply
          these concepts to build different kinds of simple musical instruments, and ultimately make some functional
          music.
        </p>
        <p>
          This workshop is aimed at Haskell beginners, and requires no prior musical knowledge. Participants are
          expected to have their own development environments already configured.

          To deliver us from this kind of negative self-talk, we'll build a small http server using the servant API and
          through example, realize there's no need to be a wizard to write useful Haskell applications.
