        <h1>Call for Contributions</h1>
        <h3>We're looking for talks, workshops and projects!</h3>
        <p>You have a Haskell project you want to present? You're working on a library or framework? You have insights
            you want to share?</p>
        <p>
            We're looking for different types of contributions:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Talks:</b> We will have several slots of 45 minutes for talks about Haskell concepts or projects.
            </li>
            <li><b>Workshops:</b> 1.5–2 hours for groups of 10–20 people. In particular, we're also looking for
                workshops aimed at Haskell beginners.</li>
            <li><b>Projects:</b> What's a hackathon without hacking? If you want to host a project, let us know, and
                we'll announce it early on. Why don't you consider offering a talk for getting people started with your
                project? If you don't want to commit just yet, we'll also offer the opportunity to spontaneously pitch
                projects at the beginning of MuniHac.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <p>If you have an idea that you would like to present or host, please send us some information, either via
            <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd36NI099SHmro1GUtMir1NgQaEehXYHJoeqmoR32hl5sB9sA/viewform">this Google Form</a>,
            or via email to <a href="mailto:munihac@tngtech.com">munihac@tngtech.com</a>.
            Please submit your proposal until <b>July 12, 2024</b>. If you've proposed a Talk or Workshop,
            we will notify you by end of July if your contribution proposal has been accepted.
