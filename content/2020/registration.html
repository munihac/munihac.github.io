        <p>Registration for MuniHac 2020 has closed. If you still want to join last minute, you can <a
                href="https://join.slack.com/t/munihac/shared_invite/zt-2i1v0wxev-M_DkjOxBpuX2B5CfPk8Nlg">register on
                Slack</a> and have a look at the <a
                href="https://munihac.slack.com/archives/C01A5LGKKPV">#munihac-2020</a> channel.</p>

        <h3>Projects</h3>

        <p>Although the focus this year is more on workshops and talks, MuniHac would not be a proper Haskell hackathon
            without some hacking sessions. We've reserved a few Zoom rooms for you to get together and hack on projects,
            so if you want to host a project at MuniHac 2020, just get in touch with us on Slack in the <a
                href="https://munihac.slack.com/archives/C01ADJQR892">#support</a> channel! We'll create a Zoom session
            and Slack channel for you, and publish them so people can join you for your project.</p>
