      <h1>About MuniHac</h1>
      <p>
        Join us at MuniHac, Munich's yearly Haskell gathering! For three days, Haskell folks from all over meet up to
        code, learn, and hang out. New to Haskell or been at it for years? Doesn't matter - we've got workshops, talks,
        and projects for everyone. It's a great chance to sharpen your skills and meet people who won't roll their eyes
        when you get excited about monads!
      </p>

      <p>
        The MuniHac is organized by
        <a href="https://www.tngtech.com/en/index.html">TNG Technology Consulting GmbH</a> and will be hosted at the TNG
        offices in Munich (Beta-Straße 13, 85774 Unterföhring).
