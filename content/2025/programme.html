          <h3>A modern step-through debugger for Haskell</h3>
          <h4>Rodrigo Mesquita</h4>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        The next step forward in best-in-class tooling for Haskell is a modern step-through debugger. The promise is
        clear, be it for beginners interactively exploring the execution of a Haskell program, or experts grappling with
        a challenging bug in a multi-million LOC codebase.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will introduce modern debugging in Haskell by example and highlight the features and robustness of the tool
        on various projects. We aim to convince users that the debugger is effortless to reach for and will become an
        essential of the future Haskell developer toolbox.

          <h3>Six Years of FUNAR – Teaching Software Architecture and Haskell to the Uninitiated</h3>
          <h4>Mike Sperber</h4>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        Since 2019, the International Software Architecture Qualification board has featured a three-day curriculum for
        Functional Software Architecture ("FUNAR") as part of its Advanced Level certification. We have taught more than
        30 trainings based on this curriculum, mostly to audiences with little or no prior exposure to functional
        programming. In the training, we work through examples written in Haskell, among them a complete web
        application. The short duration of the course (which is usually preceded by a one-day introduction to functional
        programming) puts significant constraints on how much and what it can cover, but also poses didactic challenges
        as all material must be explainable and carry over to other functional languages. Over the past six years, we
        have continually assessed the effectiveness of the course and made many iterative improvements. We'll report on
        our experience and draw some inferences not just about teaching but also about viable software architecture in
        Haskell and what its advantages and differences are with traditional software architecture.

      <p>
        We discuss history and evolution of string builders in Haskell, how linear types help us to tackle shared
        mutable state, what lessons can be learned from Java and how reading decade-old code can speed up things
        tenfold.

      <p>
        Hindsight is a typesafe, battery-included event-sourcing library for Haskell that makes event-sourced
        applications easy to write without sacrificing type-safety or performance.
      </p>
      <p>
        It currently offers three event store backends (in-memory, filesystem, PostgreSQL) with a clean, unified API.
        The type system ensures you always work with the latest event versions, automatically upcasts old events through
        migrations, and helps generate golden tests to prevent breaking changes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Features include real-time subscriptions (transient and catchup), asynchronous SQL projections for all stores,
        synchronous projections for PostgreSQL, and multi-stream transactions with version expectations à la
        EventStoreDB/KurrentDB.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hindsight is extensively tested for correctness and is benchmarked to maintain competitive performance under
        realistic business loads.

        "Programmable CAD" is a category of software where objects are defined using code. This talk covers how I’ve
        used programable CAD to design parts for 3D printing, why I think Functional Languages are uniquely suited for
        programable CAD, why I decided to write a programable CAD framework, and how the Scala Logo lead me to decorate
        a Christmas tree.

        Haskellers often prefer parser combinators to regular expressions due to the former's ability to emit
        strongly-typed data, but regexes can be pretty cool too.
        <a href="https://flora.pm/packages/@hackage/pcre2">https://flora.pm/packages/@hackage/pcre2</a> is an FFI
        binding to the PCRE2 C library along with a high-level user library. It addresses some shortcomings to the
        regex-base interface and presents additional features including compile-time checking of capture group indexes,
        van Laarhoven Traversals, and running Haskell callbacks during matching. We will tour the library with a demo
        and discuss some aspects of implementation.
