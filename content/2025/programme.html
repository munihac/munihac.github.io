        We discuss history and evolution of string builders in Haskell, how linear types help us to tackle shared
        mutable state, what lessons can be learned from Java and how reading decade-old code can speed up things
        tenfold.

        Since 2019, the International Software Architecture Qualification board has featured a three-day curriculum for
        Functional Software Architecture ("FUNAR") as part of its Advanced Level certification. We have taught more than
        30 trainings based on this curriculum, mostly to audiences with little or no prior exposure to functional
        programming. In the training, we work through examples written in Haskell, among them a complete web
        application. The short duration of the course (which is usually preceded by a one-day introduction to functional
        programming) puts significant constraints on how much and what it can cover, but also poses didactic challenges
        as all material must be explainable and carry over to other functional languages. Over the past six years, we
        have continually assessed the effectiveness of the course and made many iterative improvements. We'll report on
        our experience and draw some inferences not just about teaching but also about viable software architecture in
        Haskell and what its advantages and differences are with traditional software architecture.
