    <h2>Call for Contributions</h2>
    <h4>We're looking for talks, workshops and projects!</h4>
    <p>
      You have a Haskell project you want to present? You're working on a library or framework? You have insights you
      want to share?
    </p>

    <p>We're looking for different types of contributions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Talks:</b> We will have several slots of 45 to 60 minutes for talks about Haskell concepts or projects.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Workshops:</b> 1.5 to 2 hours for groups of 10-20 people. In particular, we're also looking for workshops
        aimed at Haskell beginners.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Projects:</b> What's a hackathon without hacking? If you want to host a project, let us know, and we'll
        announce it early on. If you don't want to commit just yet, we'll also offer the opportunity to spontaneously
        pitch projects at the beginning of MuniHac.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If you have an idea that you would like to present or host, please send us some information, either via
      <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1q7Ii928LswymDLWtrqvt3DxB3LS9Jl7FwBTjfQpABYs">this Google Form</a> (Talks
      & Workshops), or via email to <a href="mailto:munihac@tngtech.com">munihac@tngtech.com</a> (Talks, Workshops &
      Projects). Please submit your proposal until <b>August 10th 2025</b>!
