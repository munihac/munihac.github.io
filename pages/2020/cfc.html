        <h2 id="cfc">Call for Contributions</h2>

        <p><em>Update: The call for contributions has been extended to August 3rd,
                2020!</em></p>

        <p>We are encouraging talks at all levels of Haskell knowledge, and
            especially (but not exclusively) talks that have a direct perspective to
            coding, such as, for example:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Introducing a particular library, tool or compiler.</li>
            <li>In-depth explanations of existing code.</li>
            <li>Explaining a new (or existing) project that could use more outside help.</li>
            <li>Aspects of the Haskell infrastructure.</li>
            <li>â€¦</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We are looking for short talks (35 minutes + 10 minutes of questions) and
            longer workshops (120 minutes, including questions).</p>

        <p>If you have an idea that you would like to present, please send us some
            information, either via a <a href="https://forms.gle/pdqUP5K1XmFqoMwK6">Google Form</a>,
            or via email to <a href="mailto:munihac@tngtech.de">munihac@tngtech.com</a>.</p>

        <p>If you are in doubt whether something would be a good fit, feel free to
            talk to us. We also encourage contributions from first-time speakers.</p>

        <p>We will make the ultimate decision on how to structure the day(s) and how
            many slots we will offer based on the reactions to this call. The different
            nature to past years make it difficult to predict how many submissions we
            will get, so we apologise in advance should we end up having to reject good
            ideas due to timing constraints. But please don't let that possibility
            discourage you. We would like to hear from you.</p>

        <p>Please try to send us your proposals by <b>August 3rd, 2020</b>.</p>
